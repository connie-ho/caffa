# Introductions: tell them your name & your background! (see below for tips) 
* (45-60 sec total for the whole group, so 15-20 sec/person)
* As each person introduces themselves, hover over their coffee pics

# Inspiration for the project (the User Story/pitch) (Justin)
* Mexico story; talk about there's a wine and beer site but no coffee site
* (30-45 sec)
* Scroll through home page (talk about it if there's time)

# Walk-through of the main features including tech stack and challenges
(120-150 sec)
* Built with React in the front-end and express and postgres in the backend

* Justin takes a pic of his starbucks coffee
* Implemented responsive design because this app is intended to be used on your phone
* Looks like this coffee is pretty good (has four stars, don't actually click)

Connie: 
* chem/biomedical engineer I came to lighthouse because i wanted to turn my passion for software development into an actual career
and my favourite coffee is the g7 coffee
* Switch back to desktop and say, and from the main coffees page you can browse through all the coffees we have
* But for today i actually wanna sort and filter by preferences
* you can also sort and filter for the specific coffee you have in mind 
* Say you wanna see the top rated coffees, you're really interested in coffee from ethopia, brazil, indonesia and you really like dark roast with high acidity then analog coffee is the one for you 
* Go through details of the analog coffee
* And we'll even give you a suggestion where you can buy or drink this coffee (and if you click on the pin it looks like your x away from it)
* Add your review, 
* Just kidding but if you change your mind about leaving your review you can also delete it 
* After a few more sips, you find that you actually really like the coffee 

* Since search is a really important feature, we can search for the coffee in the persistent nav bar in any page
* Rosso coffee
* Image search -> add coffee 
* Wanted to make it hard for the user to add a coffee because we eventually want to make our database robust and large enough so that it contains billions of coffees and the user wouldnt really have to addd anything
* Let's go ahead and like this coffee too and let's see all of our activity on our account page

Kevin: 
Account Page (30 sec)
* On the account page I can see my most recent Favourited and Reviewed coffees on Caffa.
* If I want to revisit any of these coffees I can click on the image and it'll take me right back to the coffee I saved.
* After using Caffa for awhile and building up a list of Favourites and Reviews, I can always come back and find my older favourites and reviews.
* Finally, if I wanted to edit my profile information I can easily do so in my Profile settings.

That wraps up the demo of our Caffa App. 

Now there were a few challenges we faced as a team.

# How you worked as a team 
(30 sec)
* However, the biggest challenge was getting our API's to work on both desktop and mobile versions of our app.


Some of the things we'd like to add in the future are

# Further developments (in the future, we'd like to add this feature, etc.)
(30 sec)
* User interaction features such as following other users.
* Eventually make it into a coffee market place hub 
* Lastly, we'd also like to add admin privilleges to manage the database so when a user adds a coffee the information is accurate and consistent with the rest of our database.

* That concludes our presentation, thank you for your time and if there are any questions for us we'll be in the Caffa Session room.
